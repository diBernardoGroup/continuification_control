continuification_control 

Here we store all the videos regarding [Maffettone et al, 2023].

Specifically there are 3 folders:

1) continuous simulations: containing the videos of result of the numerical integration of the the continuified controlled model (the spatio-temporal evolution of the density and of the error function are reported);

2) discrete simulations: containing the videos of the discretizzed trials;

3) experiments: containing videos of the experiments we conducted.

In each of the folders there are 4 videos, regarding all the conditions we considered:

1) Monomodal regulation: the desired density to achieve is a static monomodal von mises function;
2) Multimodal regulation: the desired density to achieve is a static multimodal von mises function;
3) Monomodal tracking:  the desired density to achieve is a time varying monomodal von mises function;
4) Multimodal tracking: the desired density to achieve is a time varying multimodal von mises function;
